# Project Generator

The Project Generator, also known as _PG_,
is a utility tool to facilitate the creation of new openFrameworks projects,
in multiple platforms.

The content in this page is primarily target at developers willing to contribute to the code base.
If you are working with openFrameworks and would like to use the Project Generator, check the
instructions in [Create in a new project](https://openframeworks.cc/learning/01_basics/create_a_new_project/).

## Contributing

The project generator is available in two flavors:

- A command line utility tool. This option is the most versatile and provides all features.
  See more information [here](/commandLine/README.md).

- A user-interface, which works for the most typical scenarios. See more information in
the [front-end](/frontend/README.md) folder.
